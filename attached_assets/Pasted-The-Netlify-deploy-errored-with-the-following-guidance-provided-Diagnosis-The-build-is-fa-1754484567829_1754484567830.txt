The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build is failing at the stage of installing dependencies due to the `npm error code ETARGET`. The error specifies that there is no matching version found for `firebase@^11.14.0`, indicating an issue with the specified dependency version.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `firebase@^11.14.0` package exists in the `package.json` file of your project or has been committed to the repository.
2. If the package is present, the error suggests that the specified version might not be available. 
3. Update the `firebase` dependency version in your `package.json` file to a version that exists. Check the latest version available on npmjs.com and use that version or a version range that includes an existing version.
4. After updating the `firebase` dependency in `package.json`, commit the changes to trigger a new build to ensure the correct dependency version is installed.
