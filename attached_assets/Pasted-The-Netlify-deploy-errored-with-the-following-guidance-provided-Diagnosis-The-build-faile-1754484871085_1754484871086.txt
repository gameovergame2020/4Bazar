The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed during the stage of installing dependencies due to a version mismatch error for the `firebase` package. Specifically, the error indicates that no matching version was found for `firebase@^11.14.0`.

**Solution:**
1. **Verify Package Version**: Check if the `firebase` package with version `11.14.0` is available in the npm registry.
2. **Update Package Version**: If the version `11.14.0` is not available, consider updating the package.json file to use an existing version of `firebase` that satisfies the dependency requirement.
3. **Retry Build**: After making the necessary changes, trigger a new build to ensure that the correct version of the `firebase` package is installed successfully.
